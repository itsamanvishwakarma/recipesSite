    <p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines 
    native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, 
    ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally 
    available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily 
    influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices 
    and traditions. Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism 
    have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian 
    discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. 
    A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become 
    staples in many regions of India. Indian cuisine has shaped the history of 
    international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst 
    for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe 
    and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially 
    those from Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, 
    Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.</p>
