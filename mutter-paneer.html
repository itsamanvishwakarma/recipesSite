    <h1>Mutter Paneer | Mutter Paneer Recipe</h1>
    
    <img src="./img/mutter-paneer.jpg" alt="Mutter Paneer">

    <p>Mutter paneer is a popular North Indian dish of Indian cottage cheese aka paneer and peas 
    cooked in a spicy and flavoursome curry. Mutter paneer translates to peas paneer where 'mutter' 
    is the Hindi word for 'peas' and 'paneer' for “Indian cheese”. This classic dish is made in numerous ways 
    across the Indian households and every home may have a different recipe. 
    For the same reason, mutter paneer in every household and restaurant tastes different.
    For this mutter paneer recipe, I have made the gravy by sautéing onions & tomatoes with some spices. 
    Then blended this to get a smooth paste. Later it is spiced and simmered with water until 
    a thick consistency is achieved. To this green peas and paneer are added. 
    The process of sautéing brings out the subtle sweet flavor from onions and tomatoes, 
    thereby enhancing the depth of various tastes & flavors in the gravy. This sautéing part is 
    what makes this mutter paneer simply superb and unique. Though this extra step consumes a bit 
    of time it is totally worth the effort when you want to make something special like the restaurant kind. 
    Sometimes when I am pressed for time, I make it in a short cut way by simply blanching the onions 
    and pureeing them with raw tomatoes.</p>

    <h2>Instructions for making delicious Palak Paneer</h2>

    <ol>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        
        <li>Heat a pan and add 1 tbsp oil. When the oil turns hot, add</li>
           
            <ul>
                    
                <li>1 to 2 green cardamoms (optional, skip if you don't like)</li>
                <li>1 inch ginger (chopped)</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves (chopped). Saute just for a minute. I did forget to add the cardamoms here so added in the tempering later.</li>
            
            </ul>
    
        <li>Add 1 cup cubed onions. Saute them until they turn pink to light golden. The raw smell of the onions has to go away.</li>   
        <li>Then add 1½ cup chopped tomatoes, ½ teaspoon salt and 12 whole cashew nuts.</li>
        <li>Saute for 2 to 3 mins. Cover the pan. Cook on a medium flame until the onions and tomatoes turn mushy. Turn off the stove.</li>
        <li>Cool this mixture completely.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a blender jar and add ¼ to ⅓ cup curd (yogurt). Using curd is optional, use it for a rich and tangy flavor. This matar paneer tastes great even without curd.</li>
        <li>Grind to a smooth puree without adding water. We don't want any grits in the curry, so make sure this is smooth.</li>
        
        <h3>Making gravy</h3>

        <li>Heat a pan with 2 tablespoons oil. Add 1 inch cinnamon and a small bay leaf. You can also skip them and just add half teaspoon cumin seeds. Fry them for a min.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low. Add ¼ teaspoon turmeric, ¾ to 1 teaspoon red chili powder, ¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala and ½ to ¾ teaspoon coriander powder.</li>
        <li>Mix well. If the pan is too hot , the spices will burn so do it on a low heat. </li>
        <li>Pour the onion tomato puree. If your puree is not smooth, turn off the stove and then pass it through a strainer. Saute all of these until the mixture comes together & turns thick. This only takes 2 to 3 mins. Keep stirring often.</li>
        <li>Add ¾ cup boiled green peas or frozen peas. If using fresh peas, then you may need to boil them. Drain and use here. I use frozen peas, so just rinse well and add. Pour 1 to 1¼ cups water to make a gravy.</li>
        <li>Mix well. Cover and cook until the gravy thickens. Taste the gravy and add more salt if needed. Crush 1 teaspoon kasuri methi and add.</li>
        <li>Add 1 slit green chilli (optional) and 250 grams paneer. Mix gently and cover. Cook just for 1 to 2 mins. Adding green chilli at this stage gives a unique flavor but you may skip. Turn off the heat. Do not over cook.</li>
        <li>Add chopped coriander leaves and 3 to 4 tablespoons cream. Mix well. Transfer to a serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Serve matar paneer with basmati rice, naan, roti, phulka, jeera rice or ghee rice.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Ingredients & substitutes</h2>

    <ul>
    
        <li><strong>Paneer:</strong> Paneer is Indian vegetarian non-melting cheese made by curdling milk. It is easily available in Indian stores in the frozen section. You can also make your own by following this homemade paneer recipe.</li>
        <li>If you are a vegan then you can easily substitute it with extra firm tofu or Quorn. Just note that you will need to precook Quorn until tender and then add them along with green peas</li>
        <li><strong>Green peas:</strong> In India, fresh green peas are in season during the winters and most people use them as they are easily available. But mutter paneer can be made anytime of the year with frozen peas, like the way I did here.</li>
        <li><strong>Garam masala</strong> is the key spice blend in this recipe. The flavors of your matar paneer will depend highly rely on how aromatic your garam masala is. So do use a good garam masala.</li>
        <li><strong>Whole spices</strong> can be easily skipped but they slowly infuse the flavors when you simmer the gravy. The depth of flavors is not comparable when you skip them.</li>
        <li><strong>Kasuri methi</strong> are dried fenugreek leaves. They are easily available in the Indian stores selling North Indian groceries. You may skip them if you don't find but they impart a unique aroma and there is no substitute to it.</li>
        <li><strong>Cashews</strong> are used for a creamy texture. They can be replaced with soaked and blanched almonds. Alternately you may use 3 tbsps of white poppy seeds. Soak the seeds for 2 hours in warm water and grind them separately in a small grinder to a thick creamy consistency. Pour it at the last step before adding paneer. Simmer until it thickens then add paneer.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream</strong> adds a milky flavor to the gravy and also makes the dish creamier. However you may just skip it and use 6 more whole cashews.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Variations</h2>
    Matar paneer gravy can be made in many ways. Here are a few variations:

    <ul>

        <li>For the simplest version, saute fine chopped onions until deep golden, then ginger garlic and then add pureed tomatoes & cashews. Saute until thick and add spices. Pour water and make a thick gravy. Add matar and paneer to this.</li>
        <li>To add yogurt & skip cream, you can follow my restaurant dum aloo recipe. Just skip the aloo and use matar and paneer instead with the amount of water mentioned in this post. I also have instant pot version in that post.</li>
        <li>To make matar paneer without onions and garlic, you can follow my paneer makhani recipe.</li>
    
    </ul>
